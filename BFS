# BFS is ideal for searching trees and graphs when you want to visit the 
# neighbors of the node before moving on to the next set of neighbors.
# Time complexity: O(V+E), every vertex is visited at least once O(V),  and every edge ]
# is visited once as bfs explores the edges incident to each vertex O(E).
